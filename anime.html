    <h1>Sagas</h1>
    <p>The most recognizable and well-liked Shonen series of all time, Dragon Ball Z has spawned a large multimedia brand that includes manga, anime, movies, video games, and much more. The story centers on a cast of protagonists with amazing power who defend the universe and their home planet against extraterrestrials, lethal automatons, and other entities. It is the series responsible for popularizing the cliché of power levels. Throughout its many sagas, each one had formidable antagonists that the protagonists had to defeat.</p>
